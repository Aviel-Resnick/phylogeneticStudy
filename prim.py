''' Primâ€™s algorithm on a distance matrix:
1. Choose any vertex to start.
2. Delete the row in the matrix for the chosen vertex.
3. Number the column in the matrix for the chosen vertex.
4. Put a ring round the lowest undeleted entry in any of the numbered columns (if there is more than one lowest entry, choose any).
5. The ringed entry becomes the next arc to be added to the tree.
6. Repeat steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 until all rows are deleted.
