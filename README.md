# Reconstruction of Phylogenetic Trees via Levenshtein Distances of RNA

The aim of this study is to the evaluate the effectiveness of using the edit distance (Levenshtein Distance) between RNA sequences of species in reconstructing their phylogenetic tree. In order to verify accuracy, the Nodaviridae family, consisting of 9 previously studied species, is used as a benchmark. A secondary goal of the study is to compare the effectiveness of using RNA 1 against RNA 2, given that the sequences vary in size and evolutionary purpose. From a computational standpoint, optimizing the process is crucial, given the size of potential genomic data. Two significant algorithms are utilized in the study; first, edit distance is computed using a derivation of Myers' algorithm, as outlined by Heikki Hyyr√∂ in his paper on bit-parallel approximate string matching. Secondly, a variation of Prim's algorithm is used to compute the minimum spanning tree based on the distance matrix generated previously. The rooting process will occur via an outlying species, in order to construct a rooted tree which better conveys the linearity of evolution. Overall, given that comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, cancer research, and epidemiology all require tools to elucidate evolutionary patterns, research in this field is critical.
