The aim of this study is to the evaluate the effectiveness of using the edit distance (Levenshtein Distance) between RNA sequences of species in reconstructing their phylogenetic tree. The subject for reconstruction is the Nodaviridae family, consisting of 9 previously studied species, distributed over two genera. From a computational standpoint optimizing the process is crucial, given the size of potential genomic data. Two significant algorithms are utilized in the study; first, edit distance is computed using a derivation of Myers' algorithm, as outlined by Heikki Hyyrö in his paper on bit-parallel approximate string matching. Secondly, a variation of Prim's algorithm is used to compute the minimum spanning tree based on the distance matrix generated previously. Results include a complete edit distance matrix for the Nodaviridae family, as well as the corresponding MST. Finally, qualitative analysis of the data led to a potential rooted phylogenetic tree for the family. Overall, given that many fields including comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, oncological research, and epidemiology all require tools to elucidate evolutionary patterns, research in this field is critical. ​
